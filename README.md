With the release Blizzard added a new AntiAFK system, just jumping or move a step every minutes gets you kicked anyways and you be in Queue again.

Queue Dodger will focus your WoW window for a second, logout, waiting in the WoW Character Screen and login back ingame, too prevent to be AFK flagged and get kicked into the Queue. You can change the wait time if you want, default its every 5-10 minutes which is enough.

# How to use

### Run Queue Dodger as **Administrator!** 
> **Note:** Queue Dodger will block your input (Keyboard) for a second too make sure you dont overwrite the logout step if you use your Computer in the meantime. This only works if you run it as Administrator.

### Make sure you start Queue Dodger **ingame** and in a **rested area** like a city or where you can set your Hearthstone.
